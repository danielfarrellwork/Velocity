At WSP I perform various various tasks needed to win and deliver contracts for bridge rehabilitation and preservation. These include:
Creating Cost proposals based in excel to reflect scope of work outlined in RFPs.  
Writing, formatting, and editing proposals to clearly define responsible parties for design, procurement, and payment while minimizing risk to the firm. 
Use various design softwares including Autodesk, Revit, and Microstation to communicate repair design intent to contractors.
